**DISCLAIMER:**

As you embark on your Hackintosh journey you are encouraged to **READ** the entire README and [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/getting-started/) guides before you start, or check out some [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechNolli) to get an understanding of the install process. It will save many a message instructing you to read the manual. **I am not an expert**, I haven't forced you to do anything, so put on your big boy pants and take responsibility for any mess you get yourself into.

With that said I'm happy to help when/where I can. When you encounter bug or want to improve this repo, consider opening an issue or pull request. You can also find a wealth of knowledge on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/), [TonyMacX86](https://www.tonymacx86.com) or [Google](https://www.google.com).

## Introduction

<details> 
<summary><strong>This is not a guide!</strong></summary>


This is not a complete guide. It should only be used as a reference. I provide tips and tricks that I learned on my journey in building a hackintosh. The best way of using this is as a supplement to the OpenCore guide; if you have questions about how to setup your specific hardware, are unclear about what to do, or would like to see the settings I've used.

I understand that some may simply copy the EFI folder to their EFI partition. For clarity the EFI folder needs to go onto the EFI partition.

```EFI
EFI (partition)
	EFI
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BOOT
	‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OC
```

It should work and your Gigabyte z390 Designare based hackintosh should boot and work fine. **You will at minimum need to generate SMBIOS values if you want Apple services to work.** Note that all error reporting/logging has been turned off in the config.plist. You will have a difficult time trouble shooting with the setup provided. You can easily turn on the error reporting and logging if you follow the Dortania guide. Best of luck.

> **NOTE** if you simply wish to copy my EFI please do the following:
>
> 1. Properly set your [BIOS settings](https://github.com/seven-of-eleven/designare-z390-opencore-efi/blob/master/BIOS.md) (<kbd>Del</kbd> to get into bios)
> 2. [Generate SMBIOS values](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html#platforminfo) and add them in the config.plist (MacPro7,1)
> 3. **Rename** one of the `config...` files in the OC folder to `config.plist` (see release or notes below for details).
> 4. Prepare your install [USB](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/)
> 5. Move the entire EFI folder (with your modifications) to the proper partition on your [USB](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/mac-install.html#setting-up-opencore-s-efi-environment) (or [hard drive](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/oc2hdd.html) once the install is complete).
> 6. [Install](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installation/installation-process.html#double-checking-your-work) - You need to select <kbd>F12</kbd> to get the boot menu options and **boot from the USB each time the computer restarts** until you've copied the EFI folder onto the hard drive. You may also need to select the correct boot option during install, although this is typically done automatically.

To install macOS follow the guides provided by [Dortania](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) :thinking:

<summary><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è HIGHLIGHTED CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS EFI ‚ö†Ô∏è</strong></summary>



#### Choose your config

- Choose your preferred config.plist file and **rename it to config.plist**:

  - config-no-wifi-bt.plist - `disables the internal WiFi and bluetooth`
    - most similar to older Releases. Use this if you have installed a 3rd party PCIE WiFi/bt card (Fenvi or other).
    - all WiFi and Bluetooth related kexts are disabled. If you need BluetoolFixup for your card you'll need to enable it.  Also the child items listed below are commented out, simply remove the '#' at the front of the key value to enable them.
  - config-wifi-bt.plist - `enables builtin WiFi and bluetooth`
    - use this if you **don't have** PCIE card but want to enable **builtin Intel WiFi/bt**
    - Kexts provided for Ventura, and Sonoma. Restricted by Min/Max Version values.

</details>



<details> 
<summary><strong>Update or fresh install instructions for 14.4+</strong></summary>



When updating from 14.x to 14.4+, or installing 14.4+ the following is recommended:

- Set **SecureBootModel** to **Disabled** (not *default*)
- Disable all WiFi kexts if any
- Disable all Bluetooth kexts if any
- Add`revpatch=sbvmm` to  **boot-args** (if you want to update through the System Settings, otherwise just download the full installer)

After updating:

- Reset **SecureBootModel** to **Default** (or **j160** for MacPro7,1)
- Enable all WiFi and Bluetooth kexts (latest versions already included in the EFI)

> Note: All WiFi and Bluetooth kexts in the release are enabled by default.

## Installation Notes

<details>  
<summary><strong>UEFI/BIOS settings</strong></summary>
<br>


> Note <kbd>DEL</kbd> key gets you into BIOS Setting during boot.

#### Update (or downgrade) your motherboard's BIOS firmware

Use BIOS version **F9i or F9** (don't use F9j). You can download F9i from this repo's [releases page](https://github.com/seven-of-eleven/designare-z390-opencore-efi/releases/tag/resources) or F9 (the latest version) from [Gigabyte's website](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/Z390-DESIGNARE-rev-10/support#support-dl-bios).

#### BIOS configuration

Visit the [BIOS configuration](https://github.com/seven-of-eleven/designare-z390-opencore-efi/blob/master/BIOS.md) page to ensure that your BIOS is configured properly.

>Note: If you've recently updated your BIOS firmware, you will need to double-check these as some of them get reset after updating!



<details>  
<summary><strong>Thunderbolt working</strong></summary>




- Added ACPI files and updated config to enable Thunderbolt


> **DiableIoMapper is set to false to enable AppleVTD** as outlined below. Set to true if you are having issues with your Fenvi WiFi BT card.

- Enabled AppleVTD

  - Since Monterey 12.3.0, AppleEthernetE1000 driver kit natively attaches to i211 ethernet. However, if the ethernet port is occupied without having AppleVTD enabled, the system will experience freeze, crash, and etc. To avoid having these issues, we need to enable AppleVTD.

  ```
  - Enable VT-d in BIOS, 
  - Set DisableIoMapper to false
  - Drop OEM DMAR Table in config.plist
  - Inject modified DMAR Table(Reserved Memory Regions removed) in config.plist
  ```

  - Removed AppleIGB kext as it's not needed with AppleVTD enabled.

<summary><strong>Customizing the config.plist</strong></summary>
<br>



Read the official [OpenCore Desktop Guide for Coffee Lake](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html) when making changes to the `config.plist` and the guide's [Gather Files section](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/ktext.html#firmware-drivers) when picking drivers and kexts.

The following fields have been replaced by `[REPLACEME]` (for ease of <kbd>‚åò</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>):

- `config.plist` > `PlatformInfo`
  - `SystemSerialNumber`
  - `SystemUUID`
  - `MLB`
  - Follow the [OpenCore instructions](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) to generate your own unique identifiers.
- Also replace the ROM value of `11223344 5566` as outlined in the [OpenCore Instructions](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#fixing-rom)
- Choose a `SystemProductName`, either `iMac19,1` or `MacPro7,1` see **Generate your own SMBIOS** for details.
- All packages are `RELEASE` and debugging is disabled. If you're having issues, be sure to enable debugging [as described in the OpenCore docs](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config.plist/coffee-lake.html#debug), and also grab [the `DEBUG` version of OpenCorePkg](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases).

> If you're not using internal WiFi/bt you can remove the **Additional Kexts** in the Kext listing and take a snapshot with Propertree to update your config file. If you don't know what this means, just ignore it, everything will work fine üòÄ.

In the config.plist file you set the default language as outlined in the guide. You can either add it as a string or as a hex data using [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree)

The setting is found in the config.plist under: 

- NVRAM
  - 7C436110-AB2A-4BBB-A880-FE41995C9F82

Format is lang-COUNTRY:keyboard as shown below:

<details>  
<summary><strong>Ventura, or Sonoma?</strong></summary>




The EFI folder should work for either Ventura, or Sonoma. 

I would avoid installing Sonoma 14.4 as it had issues with USB mapping.

I'm primarily using this EFI with Sonoma 14.4.1 at the moment. Prior to this I was running Ventura without issue.

</details>  

<details>  
<summary><strong>Generate your own SMBIOS</strong></summary>




Use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to create your own serial #... based off of your preferred model.

- MacPro7,1 -`What I used`
  - **See below if you want to keep iMac19,1**

**Note:** If you use a different SMBIOS model other than MacPro7,1 or iMac19,1. The provided USB mapping **will not** work. You will need to edit the USBPorts.kext file.  You can right click on the file and select **Show Package Contents**.  From there you can open the Info.plist file in ProperTree and change MacPro7,1 to whatever Model ID you've chosen. This should provide a working USBPorts.kext.

### Keeping SMBIOS iMac19,1

If you've used a previous version from this repo and everything is working for you, **I would recommend you keep the iMac19,1 SMBIOS** so that you don't have to generate new serial numbers etc. In this case you can simply use Propertree to <kbd>delete</kbd> the entire `PlatformInfo` portion of the config.plist file and replace it (copy and paste) with the `PlatformInfo` from your existing config.plist file.

Alternatively you can manually update the `PlatformInfo` by adjusting the following:

| Key                | Type    | Value             |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----------------- |
| CustomMemory       | Boolean | False             |
| MLB                | String  | [REPLACEME] ^*^   |
| ROM                | Data    | 11223344 5566 ^*^ |
| SystemProductName  | String  | iMac19,1          |
| SystemSerialNumber | String  | [REPLACEME] ^*^   |
| SystemUUID         | String  | [REPLACEME] ^*^   |

##### *Replace these with your values

> **NOTE:** If you have everything working with your own USB mapping file. **KEEP IT.** Replace the provided USBPorts.kext file with the one in your existing EFI folder and perform a snapshot in Propertree for good measure.

<summary><strong>USB Mapping (active ports)</strong></summary>
<br>


> The latest version of USBPorts.kext included will work with either SMBIOS iMac19,1 or MacPro7,1.

MacOS has a fifteen port limit. You can read more about the details in the [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/). Depending on your specific needs you may want to customize/recreate the port mapping.

<summary><strong>Custom RAM Config</strong></summary>
<br>



> If you're using SMBIOS iMac19,1 you can safely ignore this and just ensure `Kernel>Add> RestrictEvents.kext`> `Enabled` is `False` in the config.plist file.

Using the **SMBIOS MacPro7,1** will require either `CustomMemory` to be configured **or** [RestrictEvents.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/RestrictEvents) to be installed. I've enabled the RestrictEvents.kext as default. If you want to create the custom memory values the details can be found in the [guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/memory.html).

<details>  
<summary><strong>Audio Setup</strong></summary>




There are three options available that I'm aware of. You can use alcid 7, 11, or 16. All three are used by different Designare EFIs available online. I'm using alcid 11 because it works for what I need. If you have specific audio requirements and alcid 11 isn't working try the other values. `Previous EFIs in this repo used alcid=7.`

> NOTE: Alcid values can be added to the 'NVRAM > boot-args' key **or** DeviceProperties. The boot-args value will override the DeviceProperties value if both are used. **You only need one**. This EFI uses the DeviceProperties method.

### Audio output quirks

3.5mm jack will show as Internal Speakers depending on the alcid you've chosen:

| alcid= | Front jack        | Rear jack         |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| 7      | Headphones        | Internal Speakers |
| 11     | Headphones        | Internal Speakers |
| 16     | Internal Speakers | Headphones        |

![audio-options](images/audio-options.png)





alcid decimal to hex value table

| Decimal | Hex value    |
| ------- | ------------ |
| 7       | 07000000     |
| **11**  | **0B000000** |
| 16      | 10000000     |

### Audio setting method used in EFI

DeviceProperties>Add

| Key                        | Type       | Value        |
| -------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3) | Dictionary |              |
| layout-id                  | Data       | **0B000000** |
